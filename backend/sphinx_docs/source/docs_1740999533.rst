To generate Sphinx-compatible reStructuredText (RST) documentation for the given XML content of a `pom.xml` file, you can follow this format:

```rst
.. _pom_xml:

==========
pom.xml
==========

.. code-block:: xml

    <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd">
      <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
      <groupId>com.github</groupId>
      <artifactId>egitdemo</artifactId>
      <packaging>jar</packaging>
      <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
      <name>egitdemo</name>
      <url>http://maven.apache.org</url>
      <dependencies>
        <dependency>
          <groupId>junit</groupId>
          <artifactId>junit</artifactId>

          <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
      </dependencies>
    </project>

```

Here's a breakdown of what's included in the RST file:

- The `.. _pom_xml:` provides a label for referencing this section of the document.
- The section title `pom.xml` is underlined with `=` to denote it as a top-level heading.
- The `.. code-block:: xml` directive declares the following block to be XML code, which enables proper syntax highlighting in the generated Sphinx documentation.
- The XML content from the `pom.xml` file is included with two spaces indentation after the `.. code-block:: xml` line.

To generate Sphinx-compatible reStructuredText (RST) for documenting the provided `.properties` file chunk, you need to format it to include headings and literal blocks. Here's how you can translate the content:

```rst
.. _resources-labels-properties:

===========================================
Resource File: resources/labels.properties
===========================================

This section documents the `resources/labels.properties` file used in our application.

.. literalinclude:: resources/labels.properties
   :language: ini

Below are the entries contained in this properties file:

- **app.title**: *Our App*
  
  This is the title of the application.

- **app.welcome**: *Welcome to the application*

  Message displayed to users upon entering the application.

- **app.goodbye**: *We hope you enjoyed using our application*

  Farewell message shown to users when they exit the application.

- **cli.usage**: *This application doesn't use a command line interface*

  Indicates that the application does not provide CLI support.
```

### Explanation:

- The RST document begins with a reference label, `.. _resources-labels-properties:`, which can be used to link to this section from other parts of the documentation.
- The main title is given a section with `=` symbols to indicate a top-level heading.
- A description of the file could be useful for context, followed by a literal block using `.. literalinclude::` to include the file contents directly if you were writing a practical Sphinx document.
- Each label in the `.properties` file is documented with bullet points, highlighting key-value pairs with descriptions to explain their relevance in the application.

Please ensure the filename matches what's used in your project structure, as that impacts how `literalinclude` is implemented.

To generate Sphinx-compatible reStructuredText (reST) for the provided Groovy source code, you can use code block directives to format the document appropriately. Below is an example of how you can structure the RST document:

```rst
Code Example: Main.groovy
=========================

The following code example demonstrates basic operations such as squaring, dividing, subtracting, and summing using static imports for simplicity.

.. literalinclude:: src/Main.groovy
   :language: groovy
   :lines: 1-20

Explanation
-----------

This Groovy script performs a number of basic arithmetic operations on a variable called `programmingPoints`:

- **Square**: Computes the square of `programmingPoints` using the `square` function.
- **Divide**: Divides `programmingPoints` by 2 using the `divide` function.
- **Subtract**: Subtracts 7 from `programmingPoints` using the `subtract` function.
- **Sum**: Adds 3 to `programmingPoints` using the `sum` function.

Example Output
--------------

Assuming that `programmingPoints` is initialized to 10, the output will be:

.. code-block:: text

   Hello Matthew
   Matthew has at least 10 programming points.
   10 squared is (result of square function)
   10 divided by 2 bonus points is (result of divide function)
   10 minus 7 bonus points is (result of subtract function)
   10 plus 3 bonus points is (result of sum function)

Replace the placeholders with the actual function results you'd like to show.
```

This structure includes a title, a brief description, code inclusion, an explanation section, and an example output section. This format is useful for documentation generated by Sphinx, making your code example and its context more understandable and accessible.

To generate Sphinx-compatible reStructuredText (RST) documentation for the Groovy source code provided, you can format it as follows:

```rst
.. _square-function:

Square Function
===============

This section describes the `square` function implemented in the `Square.groovy` file.

.. code-block:: groovy

    static int square(int base) {
        base * base
    }

Description
-----------

The `square` function takes an integer argument `base` and returns its square. This is achieved by multiplying the `base` by itself.

Parameters
----------

- `base` : int
  The integer value that needs to be squared.

Returns
-------

- int
  The square of the input integer `base`.

Usage Example
-------------

.. code-block:: groovy

    int result = square(4)
    // result is 16

Notes
-----

- This function is static, meaning it can be called without instantiating an object of the class that contains it.
```

This RST documentation includes a code block displaying the function, sections describing its purpose, parameters, return values, a usage example, and additional notes. Adjust the formatting and content as needed to fit your specific documentation style and requirements.

To generate Sphinx-compatible reStructuredText (RST) for a Groovy source code chunk, you can provide documentation in a manner that integrates code snippets effectively. Here's how you could write the RST documentation for the provided Groovy method:

```rst
.. _subtract-function:

Subtract Function
=================

This section documents the ``subtract`` function found in the ``src/Subtract.groovy`` file.

.. code-block:: groovy

    static int subtract(int val1, val2) {
        val1 - val2
    }

Description
-----------

The ``subtract`` function takes two integer parameters, ``val1`` and ``val2``, and returns their difference. It is defined as a static method.

Parameters
----------

- **val1**: (*int*) 
  The minuend, from which ``val2`` will be subtracted.

- **val2**: (*int*) 
  The subtrahend, which will be subtracted from ``val1``.

Returns
-------

- (*int*) 
  The result of subtracting ``val2`` from ``val1``.

Examples
--------

Here's a simple usage example of the ``subtract`` function:

.. code-block:: groovy

    int result = Subtract.subtract(10, 4)
    println(result)  // Outputs: 6

The above code snippet calls the ``subtract`` method with the arguments 10 and 4, which returns 6.
```

This RST document provides a comprehensive overview of the `subtract` function, its parameters, return type, and even includes an example usage. Adjust the document to fit your project's documentation standards or additional context as necessary.
