To generate Sphinx-compatible RST documentation for the provided content, we can format it accordingly. Here's how it can be represented:

```rst
.. _file-readme-txt:

README.txt
==========

This is a sample project students can use during Matthew's Git class.

Here is an addition by me

We can have a bit of fun with this repo, knowing that we can always reset it to a known good state. We can apply labels, and branch, then add new code and merge it in to the master branch.

As a quick reminder, this came from one of three locations in either SSH, Git, or HTTPS format:

- `git@github.com:matthewmccullough/hellogitworld.git`
- `git://github.com:matthewmccullough/hellogitworld.git`
- `https://matthewmccullough@github.com/matthewmccullough/hellogitworld.git`

We can, as an example effort, even modify this README and change it as if it were source code for the purposes of the class.

This demo also includes an image with changes on a branch for examination of image diff on GitHub.
```

This RST document uses section headers, bullet lists, inline code styling, and hyperlinks as needed to convert the text into a format that Sphinx can parse into documentation.
