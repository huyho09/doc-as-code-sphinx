To generate Sphinx-compatible reStructuredText (RST) documentation for the provided code and README content, we'll organize the documentation into sections that match the headings and important details from your content. This includes sections like the description, features, installation guide, usage, and more. Here's how you can structure it in RST:

If you are unsure how to install the application, please watch the `installation video <https://youtu.be/50gvfn1zg-w>`_ for a step-by-step guide, or for a demo of the bot.

.. _prerequisites:

Prerequisites
-------------

- Google Chrome (version 89 or later) must be installed on your system. You can download it from `here <https://www.google.com/chrome/>`_.
- Ensure Tesseract OCR is installed on your system. You can download it from `here <https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases/latest>`_. Additionally, make sure to add Tesseract to your system PATH. Follow this `tutorial <https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/>`_ for instructions on how to add it to the PATH on Windows 10.
- Python 3.7 or higher must be installed on your system. You can download it from `here <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.

.. note::
   If you plan to use the executable version, you do not need to install Python. Ensure that Python (if you plan to use the source code) and Tesseract OCR are added to your system's PATH.
